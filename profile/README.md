# UoM Maths Seminar

Collaborative notes, slides, and exercises for student-run pure maths reading groups & seminars at the University of Melbourne.

## What you’ll find here

This GitHub organization hosts one repository per seminar/reading group. Each repo is structured to make it easy to:
- co-author LaTeX notes and Beamer slides,
- share exercises + solutions,
- keep materials organized by week/chapter,
- accept contributions via pull requests.

## Current seminar(s)

### Algebraic Geometry (Semester 1, 2026)

**Repo:** https://github.com/UoM-Maths-Seminar/Algebraic-Geometry-2026s1

This repository is for sharing and working with algebraic geometry notes (UniMelb, S1 2026). It follows the textbook:

- *Beginning in Algebraic Geometry* (Emily Clader & Dustin Ross)

**What’s inside**
- `chapters/` — one folder per chapter/week (each includes `note.tex` + `slides.tex`)
- `templates/` — reusable LaTeX templates:
  - `templates/note-template/note-template.tex`
  - `templates/beamer-template/beamer-template.tex`

**Chapter / week map (quick view)**
- Ch.0 Polynomial Rings (prereading)
- Ch.1 Varieties and Ideals (week 1)
- Ch.2 Irreducibility of Affine Varieties (week 2)
- Ch.3 Coordinate Rings (week 3)
- Ch.4 Polynomial Maps (week 4)
- Ch.5 Proof of the Nullstellensatz (week 5)
- Ch.6 Dimension (week 6)
- Ch.7 Smoothness (week 7)
- Ch.8 Products (week 8)
- Ch.9 Projective Varieties (week 9)
- Ch.10 Maps of Projective Varieties (week 10)
- Ch.11 Quasiprojective Varieties (week 11)
- Ch.12 Culminating Topics (week 12)

## How to contribute

We welcome contributions from anyone in the reading group (and friends who spot typos!).

### Workflow
1. Fork the repo you want to edit
2. Make changes in the relevant `chapters/chX-*/` folder
3. Open a Pull Request with a short description of what you changed

## Start a new seminar repo

If you want to host a new reading group here:
- create a new repo named like `Topic-YYYYsN` (e.g., `Representation-Theory-2026s2`)
- include a top-level `README.md` with:
  - aim/scope,
  - schedule (chapter/week or talk list),
  - how to contribute,
  - any templates or tooling conventions.

## License / reuse

Licensing can differ by repository—please check each repo for details. When in doubt, open an issue and ask.
